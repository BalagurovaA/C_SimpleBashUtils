But I'm not a wolf by blood
You better stuff me l ike a hat into your sleeve
Hot fur coats of the Siberian 
Siberian
Siberian steppes
SIBERIAN steppes

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
